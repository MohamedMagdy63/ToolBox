# Python Image Processing Toolbox with Tkinter GUI

The Python Image Processing Toolbox with Tkinter GUI is an advanced project that provides a comprehensive set of tools for image preprocessing and enhancement, offering a wide range of features similar to popular photo editing software like Photoshop. This toolbox allows users to perform various transformations, filters, and adjustments on digital images to improve their visual quality, correct imperfections, and achieve stunning effects, all through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) created using the tkinter library.

## Key Features

- Image Import and Export: Support for importing images in various formats, including JPEG, PNG, and BMP. Ability to export processed images in the desired format.
- Image Enhancement Filters: A collection of filters such as sharpening, blurring, noise reduction, contrast adjustment, brightness correction, and color balance.
- Geometric Transformations: Apply rotation, scaling, and translation to modify the image's orientation, size, and position.
- Histogram Equalization: Algorithms to improve contrast and dynamic range by redistributing pixel intensities.
- Image Restoration: Restore old or damaged images by removing scratches, dust, and other imperfections.
- Image Segmentation: Separate images into meaningful regions or objects for object recognition, computer vision, and image analysis.
- Batch Processing: Process multiple images simultaneously for efficient handling of large datasets or repetitive tasks.
- User-Friendly GUI: Intuitive buttons, sliders, input fields, and real-time previews for easy interaction and visualization of image effects.
- Extensibility and Customization: Easily add custom filters, algorithms, or functionalities to enhance the toolbox.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/MohamedMagdy63/ToolBox/tree/main
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Run the GUI application:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

2. Use the GUI to perform image preprocessing and enhancement tasks. Load an image, apply desired operations, adjust parameters using sliders or input fields, and visualize the results in real-time.

3. Export the processed image by using the GUI's export or save functionality.
